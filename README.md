# Phishing-URL-checking-System
Lightweight Flask web app that detects phishing URLs using simple rule-based checks (no ML). It analyzes URL patterns — IP addresses, missing HTTPS, shorteners, suspicious keywords, long URLs and excessive subdomains — and returns a safety score. Ideal for demos and quick testing.
